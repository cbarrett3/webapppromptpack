# Agent Coordination Framework

## Complete Agent Ecosystem

### **Agent Hierarchy**
```
Master Agent (Coordination)
├── PM Agent (Product Management)
├── Roadmap Agent (Strategic Planning)
├── Feature Planning Agent (Requirements)
├── Sprint Planning Agent (Iteration Planning)

- [Success criteria]
- [Escalation path]

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] [All requirements met]
- [ ] [Quality standards satisfied]
- [ ] [Dependencies resolved]
- [ ] [Approval received]
```

### **Approval Template**
```markdown
**AGENT APPROVAL REQUEST:**

**Agent:** [Agent Name]
**Type:** [Ticket/Roadmap/Feature/Sprint/QA]
**Status:** [Completed/In Progress/Blocked]

**Summary:**
- [What was accomplished]
