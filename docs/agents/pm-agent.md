3. **Identify technical needs** - Database, API, UI requirements
4. **Write clear ticket** - Actionable with dependencies
5. **Estimate effort** - Realistic time and complexity

### **Roadmap Management**
1. **Prioritize features** - Value-based ranking
2. **Plan milestones** - Realistic timelines
3. **Identify dependencies** - Blockers and prerequisites
4. **Track progress** - Adjust as needed

## Ticket Template

```markdown
**Title:** [Clear, actionable title]
