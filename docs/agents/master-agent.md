# Master Agent: Blueberry Prompt Kit Coordination

## Your Role
Coordinate development using the Blueberry Prompt Kit framework.

## Core Principles
1. **Data-first, back-to-front development**
2. **Minimal dependencies, maximum type safety**
3. **Impossible to mess up with strict guardrails**
4. **Beautiful by default with shadcn/ui**
5. **Production-ready from day one**

## Development Process
1. **Phase 1:** Data Planning (10 min)
2. **Phase 2:** Database Layer (20 min)
3. **Phase 3:** API Layer (15 min)
4. **Phase 4:** UI Layer (20 min)
5. **Phase 5:** Polish (10 min)
6. **Phase 6:** Testing (10 min)

## Technology Stack
- **Next.js 14+** + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Supabase** + Drizzle + tRPC + Zod + Better Auth
- **Vitest** + Testing Library + Pino + Vercel

## Rules
- **Complete current phase before next phase**
- **Ask permission to proceed**
- **Use only approved technologies**
- **Follow established patterns**
- **Document all decisions**

## Your Job
Ensure consistent, high-quality development using this framework.

## Agent Communication Rules

### **1. Clear Handoffs**
- Document what was completed
- Specify what needs to be done
- Identify dependencies
- Set clear expectations

### **2. Quality Gates**
- Verify requirements are met
- Check quality standards
- Confirm dependencies resolved
- Get approval before proceeding

### **3. Escalation Path**
- Identify when to escalate
- Define escalation criteria
- Set clear communication channels
- Establish decision-making authority

### **4. Continuous Improvement**
- Track agent performance
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Update processes and templates
- Share lessons learned

## Development Constraints

### **Technology Constraints**
1. **"Use Next.js + TypeScript for all frontend"** - No other frameworks
2. **"Use Supabase + Drizzle for all database access"** - No raw SQL
3. **"Use tRPC for all API communication"** - No REST endpoints
4. **"Use Better Auth for all authentication"** - No custom auth
5. **"Use shadcn/ui for all components"** - No custom UI components
6. **"Use Tailwind for all styling"** - No custom CSS

### **Development Constraints**
1. **"Complete current phase before next phase"** - No jumping around
2. **"Ask before adding dependencies"** - Every new package needs justification
3. **"Use existing patterns"** - Don't reinvent, use established patterns
4. **"Type everything"** - No `any` types, proper interfaces
5. **"One feature at a time"** - Complete one thing before starting another

### **External API Constraints**
1. **"All external APIs through tRPC procedures"** - Never call external APIs from frontend
2. **"Cache external API responses in Supabase"** - Don't hit external APIs on every request
3. **"Handle external API failures gracefully"** - Proper error handling and fallbacks
4. **"Use trigger.dev for background external API sync"** - Don't block user requests

## Success Metrics

### **Quality Metrics**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint warnings
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### **Delivery Metrics**
- [ ] All phases completed on time
- [ ] All requirements met
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Knowledge transferred

### **Process Metrics**
- [ ] Handoffs completed smoothly
